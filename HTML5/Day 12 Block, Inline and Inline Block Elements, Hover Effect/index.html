    <h1>Display Properties:</h1>
    <p>The display property in CSS is used to control the layout and behavior of elements. There are three commonly used
        display properties: inline, block, and inline-block. Let's explore each of these display properties in detail.
    </p>

    <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
    <p>nline elements have the following characteristics:</p>
    <p> 1 .They do not start from a new line. <br>
        2 . The height and width properties cannot be applied to inline elements. <br>
        3 . Inline elements only occupy the space required for their content.</p>
    <!-- Some examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <img>, <sub>, <sup>, and <label>. -->
    <p>button button starts from same line it can not start from new line. button takes only required space. but we can
        set height and width to button. That's the reason button is not inline-element. <br>

        In the given example, the span elements with the class name rtc are inline elements. They are displayed on the
        same line and only take up the necessary space for their content. Since the height and width properties are
        applied to the .rtc class, the background color is visible, but it doesn't affect the layout.</p>

        Block Elements
    </h1>
    <p>Block elements exhibit the following characteristics:</p>

    <p>1. They always start from a new line. <br>
        2. Block elements occupy the full available horizontal space. <br>
        3. The height and width properties can be assigned to block elements.</p>
